para_classification
===================

Machine Learning  Project with a very basic launguage parsing used to classify paragraphs into Argumentative,Narrative,Descriptive and Expository .

Unfinished Right Now.
Interface:  OpenCV

Training Data: Organised in the folder training set and the code i.e. Paragraph1.cpp access this data by reading from a csv file inside the build folder

The csv file is organised as 

..Folder Path/para"Number".txt,Type

The Type maybe 

A:Argumentative
N:Narrative
D:Descriptive
E:Expository

Current Status: Feature extraction for classifing the Paragraphs, Plan to get the training set done and then apply naive bayes as the machine algorithm.
